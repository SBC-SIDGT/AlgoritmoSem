/**
 * {@code NotifyingThread} provides an specialised class on threading that adds more options to the
 * current available threading models:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <b>Notifying</b>: sometimes we want to get notified when a {@link Thread} completes
 * its execution, but the most we can do is just {@linkplain Thread#join() wait} until its
 * completion for going to the next step in our execution. {@code NotifyingThread} provides a fast,
 * powerful class for getting notified when threads we want finish, just by subscribing to the
 * <b>listener classes</b> implementing the {@link OnThreadCompletedListener} interface.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Fast development</b>: it is very common that we declare the following:
 * <pre>
 *             {@code
 *             // Class: ExampleClass
 *             public void functionWithHeavyLoad(final ArrayList<Double> params) {
 *                 final Integer value = new Random().nextInt(1337);
 *                 new Thread(new Runnable() {
 *                      public void run() {
 *                          double veryBigValue = params.get(0);
 *                          ExampleClass.this.mField = ExampleClass.this.doVeryBigMathCalc(value,
 *                          veryBigValue);
 *                      }
 *                 }).start();
 *             }
 *             }
 * </pre>
 * With {@code NotifyingThread} is as simple as declaring the method we are going to use, wrap
 * params using {@linkplain ArgumentParser} and returning the values if necessary. So, the latest
 * code will just be:
 * <pre>
 *             {@code
 *             // Class: ExampleClass
 *             public double doVeryBigMathCalc(ArgumentParser args) {
 *                 int firstValue = args.getInt("firstParam");
 *                 double secondValue = args.getDouble("secondParam");
 *                 // do calculations and store its result at: double result;
 *                 return result;
 *             }
 *
 *             public void functionWithHeavyLoad(final ArrayList<Double> params) {
 *                  final Integer value = new Random().nextInt(1337);
 *                  // Declare NotifyingThread, ArgumentParser and AtomicReference
 *                  NotifyingThread thread = new NotifyingThread();
 *                  ArgumentParser parser = new ArgumentParser(2);
 *                  AtomicReference<Double> result = new AtomicReference<>();
 *                  // Set params
 *                  parser.putParam("firstParam", value);
 *                  parser.putParam("secondParam", params.get(0));
 *                  // Set the executable by using lambdas
 *                  thread.setExecutable(this::doVeryBigMathCalc, parser, result);
 *                  // Start the thread
 *                  thread.start();
 *                  // Wait for the thread completion - we can define a listener for getting
 *                  notified.
 *                  System.out.println(result.get());
 *             }
 *             }
 *         </pre>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Adaptive</b>: {@code NotifyingThread} provides adaptive methods for setting up the
 * executables, so you can use {@linkplain Consumer}, {@linkplain Function}, {@linkplain Runnable}
 * and {@linkplain Supplier}.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * By default, this class uses its own {@link java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler} for
 * notifying <b>subscribed classes</b> that the thread has finished with an exception. If you want
 * to use yours, just setup the {@code UncaughtExceptionHandler} with {@link
 * #setUncaughtExceptionHandler(UncaughtExceptionHandler)}.
 * <p>
 * In addition, this class supports <b>async calling</b> for subscribed classes when the threads
 * finishes. Refer to {@linkplain #setShouldCallSubscribedClassesAsynchronously(boolean) async
 * execution docs} for more information.
