/**
 * Interface that classes that want to get notified by {@link NotifyingThread} must implement.
 * <p>
 * {@code OnThreadCompletedListener} provides an <b>easy access method</b> for classes to get
 * notified when a {@link NotifyingThread} finishes.
 * <p>
 * This <b>listener</b> is useful for both:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <b>Handling finished threads</b>, by using the {@code Runnable} param included
 * <b>always</b> with this method call. That {@code Runnable} will have the just finished
 * thread, and cannot be {@code null} (refer to {@link NotifyingThread#run()} for more
 * information).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Managing exceptions</b>: by default, {@link NotifyingThread} manages the
 * <b>unhandled exceptions</b> by itself, when creating a new instance, assigning the
 * {@linkplain NotifyingThread#setUncaughtExceptionHandler(Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler) method
 * call} to itself, for managing and including the exception when <b>it happens while executing</b>
 * the thread. Refer to {@link NotifyingThread#uncaughtException(Thread, Throwable)} for more
 * information.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * At any time you can <b>override</b> the {@linkplain NotifyingThread#setUncaughtExceptionHandler(Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler)
 * uncaught exception handler} for setting up a custom behaviour, knowing that, when an exception
 * occurs, {@link #onThreadCompletedListener(Thread, Throwable)} will not be called.
