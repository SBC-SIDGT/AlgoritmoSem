/**
 * {@code ThreadsPooling} provides a <b>fast, easy</b> access to a pool of threads that concurrently
 * must be running, with upper limits.
 * <p>
 * It handles {@linkplain ThreadPoolExecutor} and {@linkplain BlockingQueue} of {@code Runnable} s,
 * manipulating and offering access to {@linkplain ThreadPoolExecutor} methods without
 * <b>high user interaction</b>: by using the custom {@link Builder} (invoked via
 * {@link ThreadsPooling#builder()}), a developer can <b>easily</b> setup this class with the
 * requirements needed for an optimum execution.
 * <p>
 * In addition, this class <b>provides some useful</b> handlers when a new thread <b>is
 * rejected</b>: for example, if th {@code queue} is full, a {@link RejectedExecutionHandler}
 * subclass will be called, with the {@code Runnable} with the just rejected thread and {@code
 * ThreadPoolExecutor} with the executor that rejected the thread. There are <b>several
 * predefined</b> handlers with some "default" options that can satisfy daily developers work:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@linkplain #DEFAULT_REJECTED_EXECUTION_HANDLER}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@linkplain #NO_ACTION_ON_REJECTED_HANDLER}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@linkplain #IMMEDIATELY_RUN_ON_REJECTED_HANDLER}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@linkplain #WAIT_SHUTDOWN_RUN_TASK_ON_REJECTED_HANDLER}
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All those handlers can be access instantly from within the class and used {@linkplain
 * Builder#withRejectedExecutionHandler(RejectedExecutionHandler) inside the builder} for using the
 * one you prefer.
